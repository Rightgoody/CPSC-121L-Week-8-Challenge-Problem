# Week-8-Challenge-Problem

#### This was created on 10/12/23 for the purpose of storing the problem and my attempt at it 
<br/>

**Challenge:** 
<br />

Design a C++ class to represent a stock market. Stock market is a very complex concept to design completely. For this problem, you need to store only the transactions that happen in the stock market. More specifically, you need to ***store the date of the transaction***, ***name of the stock that was transacted***, and ***the price of the stock***. <br />
#### For example:
To represent a transaction that happened on 9th Oct 2023 for GOOG at a price of $137.05. You can represent the date as “10-9-2023”, name of the stock as “GOOG” and price as 137.05.
A stock can have multiple transactions on the same day. 
<br/>

This way you can store all the transactions in the stock market. 
<br />

### The class should have support the following behaviors:
<ul>
  <li>Given a date and a stock name, it should return the number of transactions that happened for that stock on that day.</li>
  <li>Given a date, it should return the total number of transactions that happened on that day.</li>
  <li>Given a stock name, return the date when the price of the stock was maximum.</li>
</ul>
